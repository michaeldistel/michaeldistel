# Michael Distel

I like the messy middle: prototype -> V1 -> customers.

I build tools and workflow software where reliability matters. Operator habits, builder mindset.

## Now

- Shipping side projects (devtools, automation, and small workflow improvements)
- Prototyping fast with AI and agent workflows, then hardening what matters
